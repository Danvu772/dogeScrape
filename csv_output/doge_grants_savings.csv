HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT,Fair Housing Center of Northern Alabama,"PURPOSE: THE FAIR HOUSING CENTER OF NORTHERN ALABAMA (FHCNA) IS REQUESTING FUNDING TO SUPPORT FAIR HOUSING ENFORCEMENT, EDUCATION-OUTREACH, AND ADVOCACY WORK IN THE 29 COUNTIES OF NORTHERN ALABAMA. FUNDING WILL ALLOW THE CENTER TO CONTINUE ITS WORK IN UNDERSERVED, RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITIES AND TO EXTEND SERVICES IN UNSERVED COMMUNITIES TO ADDRESS THE INADEQUACIES IN HOUSING. FUNDING FHCNA WILL ALLOW THE CENTER THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS POVERTY, SEGREGATION, INADEQUATE HOUSING STOCK, LACK OF EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES, AND OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING HOUSING AND HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES. FHCNA'S PURPOSE IS TO SUPPORT DIVERSITY IN HOUSING, TO INCLUDE SUFFICIENT HOUSING STOCK, ADVOCATE FOR SUPPORTIVE AND NEEDED AMENITIES IN MANY NEIGHBORHOODS SUCH AS MEDICAL FACILITIES, BANKS, LENDERS, ADEQUATE FOOD SUPPLY AND RECREATIONAL FACILITIES, ALL WHICH MAKE UP AN IDEAL COMMUNITY. FHCNA FUNDED IS ALSO NEEDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR SMALL TOWN OFFICIALS WHO MIGHT NOT BE AS WELL VERSED IN WHAT AFFIRMATIVELY FURTHERING FAIR HOUSING AND ADDRESSING RACIAL EQUITY MEANS TO THEIR COMMUNITIES AND HOW ADDRESSING THESE WILL OPEN DOORS FOR OTHER COMMUNICATIONS AND ACHIEVEMENTS.; ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED: FILL ANY VACANCIES NEEDED, ASSIGN STAFF TO PROJECT AND REVIEW ALL TASKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE POSITIONS. FHCNA PROPOSES TO CONDUCT MEETINGS WITH CITY AND COUNTY OFFICIALS AND OTHER PROVIDERS OF HOUSING TO DISCUSS VARIOUS TOPICS SUCH AS HOUSING STOCK, EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES, SEGREGATION, RESIDENTS WITH LIMITED ENGLISH DEFICIENCIES, DISABILITY ISSUES, ACCESSIBILITY TO CAPITAL, AND OTHER ISSUES THAT IMPACT GROWTH OF COMMUNITIES AND IMPACT ON RESIDENTS. FHCNA WILL CONTINUE TO PARTNER WITH AGENCIES THAT REPRESENT VARIOUS SEGMENTS OF THE COMMUNITIES SUCH AS HISPANICS, AFRICAN AMERICANS, DISABLED, PERSONS WITH LIMITED ENGLISH DEFICIENCIES, RURAL, LOW-INCOME, UNDERSERVED AND UNSERVED COMMUNITIES. STAFF WILL ATTEND COMMUNITY AND NEIGHBORHOOD MEETINGS IN AREAS THAT HAVE ESTABLISHED GROUPS OR WILL CONVENE WHERE FEASIBLE MEETINGS TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF THE RESIDENTS. FHCNA WILL HOST ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSIONS TO ALLOW HOUSING PROVIDERS AND SOCIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO OPENLY DISCUSS AREAS OF NEED THEY SEE IN THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVICE AND SUGGESTED METHODS FOR ADDRESSING THE INEQUITIES THAT WILL BEST BENEFIT THEIR CLIENTS. FHCNA WILL ALSO HOLD ITS ANNUAL FAIR HOUSING MONTH SEMINAR AND LUNCHEON THAT PROVIDES FAIR HOUSING INFORMATION FROM NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED AND LOCAL FAIR HOUSING ADVOCATES ON SPECIFIC TOPICS OF INTEREST BOTH LOCALLY AND ON THE NATIONAL SCENE. SESSIONS WILL ADDRESS REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS, DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION, LENDING, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, AND OTHER TOPICS THAT IMPACT HOUSING AND THE LACK OF EQUITABLE ACCESS TO HOUSING. THE STUDENT POSTER CONTEST WILL REMAIN AN ADDITION TO OUR FAIR HOUSING MONTH CELEBRATION. HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS FROM ALL 29 COUNTIES ARE ENCOURAGED TO PARTICIPATE. WE WILL CONTINUE DISTRIBUTING INFORMATION IN ENGLISH, SPANISH, GERMAN, AND KOREAN AS SOON AS IT BECOMES AVAILABLE. BILLBOARDS WILL BE STRATEGICALLY PLACED BASED UPON RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE MEDIA COMPANY FOR BEST EXPOSURE PARTICULARLY IN RURAL AREAS IN BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH. OUR SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN USING FACEBOOK, TWITTER, LINKIN, OUR WEBSITE AND OTHER SOCIAL PLATFORMS WILL CONTINUE TO BE UTILIZED AS A MEANS OF DISTRIBUTING FAIR HOUSING INFORMATION. PERSONS ATTENDING ANY EVENTS REQUIRING SPECIAL ASSISTANCE WILL BE ASKED TO MAKE THEIR REQUEST IN ADVANCE SO THAT SERVICES MAY BE PROVIDED. WITH A.I. BECOMING A CONCERN IN THE HOUSING INDUSTRY PARTICULARLY REGARDING LENDING, AS NEW INFORMATION IS DEVELOPED, FHCNA WILL USE BILLBOARDS AND OTHER PRINTED MATERIALS TO ENLIGHTEN THE COMMUNITIES. OUR ENFORCEMENT COMPONENT WILL SERVE THE SEVEN PROTECTED CLASSES GUARANTEED PROTECTIONS UNDER THE FAIR HOUSING ACT. WE WILL INVESTIGATE COMPLAINTS OF ALLEGED HOUSING DISCRIMINATION, MEDIATE OR CONCILIATE AGREEMENTS AND/OR MAKE REFERRALS TO HUD, DOJ OR PRIVATE ATTORNEYS. ALL INTAKES WILL FOLLOW THE HUD APPROVED INTAKE PROCEDURES. ALL NON-FAIR HOUSING CASES WILL BE REFERRED TO OTHER AGENCIES FOR ASSISTANCE. WHERE FAIR HOUSING COMPLAINANTS REQUIRE OUR SERVICES AND THOSE OF OTHER AGENCIES, PROPER REFERRALS WILL BE MADE. THE ENFORCEMENT COMPONENT WILL CONSIST OF RECRUITING AND TRAINING POTENTIAL TESTERS. MAKING TEST ASSIGNMENTS, DEBRIEFING TESTERS, AND EVALUATING TEST TO DETERMINE THE NEXT ACTION. FHCNA WILL CONDUCT BOTH COMPLAINT AND SYSTEMIC BASED TEST. THE TYPES OF TESTS WILL INCLUDE RENTAL, SALES, LENDING AND INSURANCE. MORE COMPLEX TEST SUCH AS DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION, APPRAISAL BIAS, SEXUAL ORIENTATION, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND CRIMINAL BACKGROUNDS HAVE ALL BEEN DEALT WITH BEFORE BUT ONLY AFTER A COMPLAINT HAS BEEN FILED AND WILL CONTINUE ON AN AS NEED BASIS UNTIL STAFF HAS RECEIVED TRAINING FOR THE MORE COMPLEX TESTING AND FEEL KNOWLEDGEABLE ENOUGH TO CONDUCT SYSTEMIC TESTING. THE SPECIFIC NUMBER OF EACH TYPE OF TEST WILL DIFFER EACH YEAR AND ADJUSTMENTS WILL BE MADE DURING NEGOTIATIONS TO REFLECT OUR PREVIOUS TESTS RESULTS, TYPES OF COMPLAINTS AND RESOLUTIONS. C. EXPECTED OUTCOMES: OUR AFFIRMATIVELY FURTHERING FAIR HOUSING ADVOCACY AND RACIAL EQUITY WORK SHOULD GENERATE PARTICULARLY IN RURAL, LOW-INCOME, UNSERVED AND UNDERSERVED AREAS, DISCUSSIONS ON LACK OF HOUSING STOCK, LACK OF JOB OPPORTUNITIES, NEED FOR SPECIALIZED HOUSING FOR THE ELDERLY AND DISABLED, AND SPECIAL ASSISTANCE FOR PERSONS WITH LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY. MEETINGS WITH OFFICIALS, COMMUNITY STAKE HOLDERS AND RESIDENTS WILL BEGIN A DIALOGUE AND THE PROCESS OF ADDRESSING CIVIL RIGHTS, SEGREGATION/INTEGRATION, PROBLEMS FACING THE BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES, NEED FOR IMPROVED INFRASTRUCTURE, LIMITED ACCESS TO HOUSING, HOUSING MOBILITY, LACK OF ACCESS TO CAPITAL, AND OTHER LIMITED RESOURCES. IN SOME LOW-INCOME, RURAL COMMUNITIES, REGARDLESS OF THE EFFORTS MADE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE INEQUITIES IN HOUSING CHOICE, LITTLE OR NO PROGRESS WILL BE MADE DUE TO THE LIMITED HOUSING STOCK AND OWNERSHIP OF MUCH OF THAT STOCK. FROM THE INITIAL CONTACTS IN SOME OF THE SMALL RURAL AREAS, MANY CITY OFFICIALS ARE NOT AWARE OF POSSIBLE SOURCES OF FUNDING AND ONLY RELY UPON THEIR CDBG ALLOCATIONS FROM THE STATE FOR NON-ENTITLEMENT CITIES. FROM OUR ADVOCACY WORK IN THOSE AREAS, SOME SMALL EFFORTS TOWARD MAKING IMPROVEMENTS SHOULD BECOME EVIDENT OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. MAKING THE RESIDENTS AWARE OF THEIR FAIR HOUSING RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS THROUGH OUR MEDIA CAMPAIGNS, USING BILLBOARDS, PRINTED MATERIALS IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES, RADIO AND TELEVISION PSA'S WHERE POSSIBLE AND FACE TO FACE MEETINGS, WILL INEVITABLY CHANGE THEIR LIVES AND THEIR EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT CAN AND COULD POSSIBLY CHANGE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. WE ANTICIPATE AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS BEING FILED DUE TO OUR WORK IN BOTH OUR RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITIES IF THIS PROPOSAL IS FUNDED. INCREASING THE UNDERSTANDING OF FAIR HOUSING IN ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES, ESPECIALLY IN THE UNDERSERVED AND UNSERVED AREAS, THOSE BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES, COMMUNITIES WITH PERSONS OF LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY AND LOW-INCOME AREAS, WITH A CLEARER UNDERSTANDING OF THE LAW, PERSONS WILL BETTER RECOGNIZE ACTS OF HOUSING DISCRIMINATION AND WILL BE MORE INCLINED TO FILE COMPLAINTS. WITH FREQUENT PERSONNEL CHANGES IN MULTI-FAMILY HOUSING PROVIDERS, FAIR HOUSING TRAININGS ARE ESSENTIAL TO THEIR PROVIDING QUALITY SERVICES AND WILL BE A CONTINUED SERVICE OFFERED. WHEN PROVIDING TRAININGS TO HOUSING PROVIDERS, AND OTHER INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS, SUCH AS BUILDERS, OWNERS, AND ARCHITECTS, SOME DISCUSSIONS WILL INCLUDE REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION REQUEST, AND DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION ISSUES WITH MANY CURRENT UNITS. DISCUSSIONS SURROUNDING THE NEED FOR NEW SINGLE FAMILY ACCESSIBLE HOUSING, AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN ACCESSIBLE MULTI-FAMILY UNITS, THE AGING POPULATION AND THE APPARENT NEED FOR THIS HOUSING AND THE FINANCIAL IMPACT THESE NEW HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES WOULD PRESENT SHOULD RESULT IN SOME EVENTUAL CONSTRUCTION. NEW CONSTRUCTION IN ALL AREAS WHETHER LARGE, SMALL, RURAL OR URBAN COMMUNITIES WOULD GENERATE JOB OPPORTUNITIES THUS MAKING A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY. OUR WORK WITH STUDENTS THROUGH OUR ANNUAL POSTER AND POETRY CONTESTS WILL SERVE TO INTRODUCE THEM TO THE CONCEPT OF FAIR AND EQUAL HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL PEOPLE. PROVIDING THEM, THEIR SCHOOLS AND FAMILIES WITH FAIR HOUSING LITERATURE WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLDS WITH VALUABLE INFORMATION. ALL OF OUR ADVOCACY WORK THROUGH EDUCATION AND TRAININGS, COMMUNITY MEETINGS, DISCUSSIONS WITH CITY AND COUNTY OFFICIALS, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW PARTNERSHIPS WITH SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES, INTEREST GROUPS, PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE LOCAL HBCU'S, OTHER ADVOCACY GROUPS THAT REPRESENT LGBTQ+, HISPANIC AND OTHER ETHNICITIES, THE NAACP, RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS, AND OTHERS; EXPECTED OUTCOMES: EXPECTED OUTCOMES: OUR AFFIRMATIVELY FURTHERING FAIR HOUSING ADVOCACY AND RACIAL EQUITY WORK SHOULD GENERATE PARTICULARLY IN RURAL, LOW-INCOME, UNSERVED AND UNDERSERVED AREAS, DISCUSSIONS ON LACK OF HOUSING STOCK, LACK OF JOB OPPORTUNITIES, NEED FOR SPECIALIZED HOUSING FOR THE ELDERLY AND DISABLED, AND SPECIAL ASSISTANCE FOR PERSONS WITH LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY. MEETINGS WITH OFFICIALS, COMMUNITY STAKE HOLDERS AND RESIDENTS WILL BEGIN A DIALOGUE AND THE PROCESS OF ADDRESSING CIVIL RIGHTS, SEGREGATION/INTEGRATION, PROBLEMS FACING THE BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES, NEED FOR IMPROVED INFRASTRUCTURE, LIMITED ACCESS TO HOUSING, HOUSING MOBILITY, LACK OF ACCESS TO CAPITAL, AND OTHER LIMITED RESOURCES.

WITH INCREASED KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR FAIR HOUSING RIGHTS, WE ANTICIPATE AT LEAST A 10 TO 15% INCREASE IN COMPLAINTS IN THE FIRST YEAR AND A GREATER INCREASE YEAR TWO AND THREE. THESE ALLEGED COMPLAINTS, AFTER THOROUGH INVESTIGATIONS, ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE OUR NUMBER OF CREDIBLE, LEGITIMATE FILINGS WITH HUD, DOJ OR PRIVATE ATTORNEYS. SITE VISITS TO UNSERVED AND UNDERSERVED AREAS WILL PROVIDE NEEDED INFORMATION TO DETERMINE THE LIKELY HOOD OF SUCCESSFUL TESTING. DUE TO THE LACK OF HOUSING STOCK IN SOME AREAS, WE ACKNOWLEDGE TESTING WILL NOT BE FEASIBLE. WORK IN NEW AND OR UNTAPPED TERRITORY WILL ALSO ASSIST IN OUR TESTER RECRUITMENT EFFORTS. WHERE TESTING IN THEIR COMMUNITIES WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE, NEW TESTERS CAN BE ASSIGNED TEST IN OTHER CITIES AND COUNTIES. D. INTENDED BENEFICIARIES: FHCNA WILL PROVIDE FAIR HOUSING EDUCATION-OUTREACH AND ENFORCEMENT SERVICES TO ALL PERSONS PROTECTED BY THE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT AND ALL CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS ADDRESSING FAIR AND EQUAL ACCESS TO HOUSING. THIS WILL INCLUDE ALL RESIDENTS IN OUR 29 COUNTIES SERVICE AREA.; INTENDED BENEFICIARIES: ASSISTANCE WILL BE PROVIDED REGARDLESS OF RACE, COLOR, NATIONAL ORIGIN, RELIGION, SEX, FAMILIAL STATUS OR DISABILITY. FHCNA STAFF WILL ATTEMPT TO COVER RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITIES, REGARDLESS OF INCOME AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC STATUS. MUCH EMPHASIS WILL BE PLACED ON RURAL, LOW-INCOME COMMUNITIES, BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES, AREAS WITH LIMITED ENGLISH SPEAKING RESIDENTS, SEGREGATED COMMUNITIES, COMMUNITIES LACKING ACCESS TO CAPITAL, AND COMMUNITIES WITH LOW HOUSING STOCK. DUE TO THE NUMBER OF REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION COMPLAINTS, EMPHASIS WILL ALSO BE DIRECTED TOWARDS PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. WITH AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF APPRAISAL BIAS COMPLAINTS IN OUR SERVICE AREA, WITH MUCH OF THE INFORMATION COMING FROM REAL ESTATE PROFESSIONALS AND SOME MINORITY LENDERS, THE CENTER HAS FORMED AN APPRAISAL BIAS TASK FORCE TO STUDY ITS IMPACT. WE WILL INVESTIGATE ALLEGED APPRAISAL BIAS CASES WHEN OUR EXPERTISE AND RESOURCES WILL PERMIT. FHCNA HAS BEEN LIMITED IN ITS WORK IN SOME OF THE COUNTIES IN THE NORTHERN MOST PART OF OUR SERVICE AREA DUE TO DISTANCE AND LACK OF COMMUNICATION. WITH THE COVID PANDEMIC AND THE NEED FOR STUDENTS TO ACCESS COMPUTERS WHILE STUDYING FROM HOME, TOWERS WERE ERECTED GIVING RESIDENTS ACCESS TO CELLPHONE SERVICE AND GREATER USE OF COMPUTERS. PEOPLE IN THOSE AREAS ARE NOW ABLE TO ACCESS SOCIAL MEDIA NETWORKS SUCH AS FACEBOOK, LINKEDLN, TWITTER, OUR WEBPAGE AND OTHERS WHERE WE SHARE VALUABLE FAIR HOUSING INFORMATION. OUR VIEWER NUMBERS INCREASED OVER THE LAST YEAR SUPPORTING OUR THEORY THAT IMPROVED MEDIA ACCESS HAS LED TO GREATER EXPOSURE TO OUR FAIR HOUSING INFORMATION. THEREFORE, INCREASING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE BENEFITTING FROM OUR PROJECT. FUNDING FOR THIS PROPOSED PROJECT WILL ONLY INCREASE OUR SERVICES AND IMPACT A GREATER NUMBER OF PEOPLE. THE AREAS REFERENCED ARE HIGHLY POPULATED WITH BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE, LOW-INCOME COMMUNITIES, LOW HOUSING STOCK, SEGREGATED AND HAVE RESIDENTS WITH LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY, ARE RURAL AND EITHER UNDERSERVED OR UNSERVED. THIS HAS PROVIDED GREATER PENETRATION INTO OUR TARGET COMMUNITIES SERVICING A TARGETED GROUP OF PEOPLE. FHCNA CONTINUES TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF ITS URBAN AREAS WHERE SEGREGATION REMAINS A CONCERN, WHERE GENTRIFICATION CONTINUES TO DISPLACE RESIDENTS, WHERE AFFORDABLE HOUSING REMAINS A MAJOR CONCERN. OUR ADVOCACY EFFORTS REMAIN A PRIORITY IN IDENTIFYING THE NEEDS OF THESE COMMUNITIES AND THE PEOPLE IMPACTED. IN MOST OF THESE COMMUNITIES, PEOPLE OF COLOR AND LOW-INCOME ARE THE NEGATIVE BENEFICIARIES OF THESE INEQUITIES. OTHERS WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM THE PROPOSED PROJECT ARE VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC ABUSE, THOSE ENTERING THE COMMUNITY WITH CRIMINAL BACKGROUNDS, AND WHERE SOURCE OF INCOME IS PROHIBITING ACCESS TO HOUSING. THE CONDITIONS HIGHLIGHTED ABOVE WILL IMPACT PEOPLE OF ALL SEVEN PROTECTED CLASSES IN AT LEAST ONE WAY IN OUR 29 COUNTIES SERVICE AREA.; SUBRECIPIENT ACTIVITIES: NONE",2/27/2025,702022.0

USAID,WEST AFRICA BLUE,"WEST AFRICA BLUE (“BLUE”)’S PROJECTS ARE DEDICATED TO THE CONSERVATION AND RESTORATION OF MANGROVE ECOSYSTEMS THROUGHOUT WEST AFRICA, WITH A FOCUS ON GUINEA AND SIERRA LEONE. THE PRIMARY GOALS OF THESE PROJECTS ARE TO MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE, PROTECT CRITICAL BIODIVERSITY, AND ENHANCE THE LIVELIHOODS OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES. BLUE’S FIRST PROJECT IN SIERRA LEONE WAS RECENTLY PUBLISHED AS A PIPELINE LISTING ON VERRA’S VERIFIED CARBON STANDARDS (VCS) REGISTRY IN AUGUST 2023 AND CAN BE FOUND HERE. GENERAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND COUNTRIES’ CONTEXT: ACCORDING TO THE USAID - FOREST CARBON, MARKETS AND COMMUNITIES (FCMC) PROJECT, MANGROVES IN WEST AFRICA REPRESENT 13% OF MANGROVE FORESTS WORLDWIDE AND COVER MORE THAN 2.4 MILLION HECTARES ACROSS 19 COUNTRIES. HOWEVER, THE REGION HAS EXPERIENCED A RAPID LOSS OF ITS MANGROVE COVER AT A RATE OF 1.7% PER YEAR. AT THE SAME TIME, COASTAL COMMUNITIES IN WEST AFRICA FACE HIGH POVERTY LEVELS, INEQUALITY, FOOD INSECURITY, AND VULNERABILITY TO THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE SUCH AS SEA LEVEL RISE AND COASTAL EROSION. WOMEN IN PARTICULAR FACE INCREASED ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL MARGINALIZATION AND CLIMATE VULNERABILITY. BLUE’S PROJECT AREAS ARE HOME TO TRADITIONAL FISHING COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE TURNED TO MANGROVE CUTTING AS A WAY TO MAKE INCOME DUE TO DEPLETED FISH STOCKS FROM FOREIGN TRAWLERS. MANGROVE FORESTS IN SIERRA LEONE AND GUINEA ARE BEING DEFORESTED DUE TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS SELLING MANGROVE WOOD OR USING IT FOR PRESERVING FISH THROUGH SMOKING, FUEL FOR COOKING, CONSTRUCTION PURPOSES, OR OTHER USES. FURTHER, MANGROVES PLAY AN ESSENTIAL ROLE AS NURSERY AREAS FOR FISH AND SHELLFISH, WHICH CONTRIBUTE MORE THAN $400 MILLION ANNUALLY TO THE REGIONAL ECONOMY. MANGROVE FORESTS ARE ALSO IMPORTANT FOR STABILIZING THE SHORELINE AND BUFFERING COMMUNITIES AGAINST THE IMPACTS OF STORMS AND SEA LEVEL RISE. GUINEA GUINEA’S CONTINENTAL SHELF EXTENDS 300 KM, COVERING A 47,400 KM2 AREA DOTTED BY INLETS, TIDAL MARSHES, ESTUARIES, AND NUMEROUS OFFSHORE ISLANDS. MANGROVE AREAS, WHICH EXTEND ALONG MOST OF THE COAST AND UP TO 40 KM INLAND, REMAIN LARGE AND BIODIVERSE, BUT HAVE DECLINED BY MORE THAN 30% SINCE THE EARLY 1980S. A 2019 SURVEY BY NASA ESTIMATES TOTAL MANGROVE COVER AT 2,076 KM2, OF WHICH ONLY 1,000 KM2 CAN BE UTILIZED FOR SUSTAINABLE COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.¹ THE GUINEAN MANGROVES ARE A COASTAL ECOREGION OF MANGROVE SWAMPS IN RIVERS AND ESTUARIES NEAR THE SHORELINE OF WEST AFRICA FROM SENEGAL TO SIERRA LEONE AND ARE HOME TO OVER 500 CRITICALLY ENDANGERED, ENDANGERED AND/OR VULNERABLE SPECIES ON THE IUCN RED LIST. THE ACTIVITY AREA FOR GUINEA WILL BE IN THE FORECARIAH AND COYAH PREFECTURES AND WILL HAVE A FOCUS ON RESTORATION IN ADDITION TO CONSERVATION.",3/1/2025,668507.0

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS ENDORSED BY THE SAGE WORKING GROUP ON VACCINE HESITANCY, AND PRIOR RESEARCH, ILLUSTRATE THAT INTERVENTIONS TO REDUCE VACCINE HESITANCY AND INCREASE VACCINE UPTAKE IN LATINXS SHOULD ADOPT STRATEGIES THAT: INCREASE VACCINE CONFIDENCE AND CONVENIENCE; REDUCE VACCINE COMPLACENCY; AND RESPOND TO CONTEXTUAL, INDIVIDUAL AND VACCINE-RELATED FACTORS DRIVING HESITANCY, WHICH INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND STRUCTURAL RACISM. WHILE A VARIETY OF STRATEGIES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO ADDRESS VACCINE HESITANCY IN PRIORITY POPULATIONS, THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IN COMMUNITY-BASED INTEGRATED HEALTH CARE SETTINGS HAS BEEN OVERLOOKED. YET BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, PARTICULARLY WITHIN FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS (FQHCS) WHICH TARGET SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH, MAY BE AN IDEAL SETTING TO REACH LATINXS, AND OTHER PRIORITY POPULATIONS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS, TO ADDRESS VACCINE HESITANCY AND PROMOTE VACCINE UPTAKE. IN COLLABORATION WITH EAST BOSTON NEIGHBORHOOD HEALTH CENTER (EBNHC), THE LARGEST FQHC OF MASSACHUSETTS, THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL EVALUATE A NOVEL MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING (MI) BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTION TO REDUCE VACCINE HESITANCY AND INCREASE COVID-19 AND INFLUENZA VACCINE UPTAKE IN LATINX ADULTS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS. KEY TO THE INTERVENTION IS THAT THE PROPOSED MI PROTOCOL EXPLICITLY ACKNOWLEDGES CULTURAL VALUES THAT ARE CENTRAL TO THE LATINX POPULATION AND THAT IMPACT THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. ADDITIONALLY, THE INTERVENTION HAS BEEN SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO BE FEASIBLE AND READILY IMPLEMENTED IN COMMUNITY-BASED SETTINGS, AND TO BE SUSTAINABLE IN THE LONG-TERM REGARDLESS OF HOW THE RAPIDLY CHANGING COVID-19 VACCINATION LANDSCAPE EVOLVES. TO RIGOROUSLY EVALUATE THE INTERVENTION, WE WILL CONDUCT A PRAGMATIC MULTIPLE-PERIOD CLUSTER-RANDOMIZED CROSSOVER TRIAL WITHIN FOUR BH PROGRAMS AT EBNHC; KEY TO THIS DESIGN IS THAT EACH PROGRAM SERVES AS ITS OWN CONTROL AND THAT THE MULTIPLE SWITCHES ENHANCE STATISTICAL POWER. TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, THIS WILL BE THE FIRST STUDY TO RIGOROUSLY EXAMINE THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF BH PROVIDERS IN INCREASING VACCINE UPTAKE AMONG LATINX ADULTS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS, A PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE POPULATION. KEY TO THE ANTICIPATED IMPACT IS THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE ACADEMIA-BASED RESEARCH TEAM AND COLLEAGUES AT EBNHC WHICH, IN TURN, WILL SUPPORT THE RAPID TRANSLATION OF EVIDENCE INTO PRACTICE TOGETHER WITH A MODEL FOR SUSTAINABLE COLLABORATION AND NATIONAL SCALEUP.",3/23/2025,572179.0

DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES,Washington University,"RELIGION AND SUPPORT FOR GENOMIC HEALTHCARE: AN EXPLORATORY STUDY OF THE US PUBLIC AND FAITH LEADERS. - PROJECT SUMMARY RELIGION IS A PRIMARY DRIVER OF CONCERNS WITH GENOMICS AND GENOMIC HEALTHCARE (GGH). IT IS VITAL FOR RESEARCH ON THE ETHICAL, LEGAL, AND SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS (ELSI) OF GENOMICS TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF RELIGION IN SHAPING PUBLIC ATTITUDES TOWARD GGH. NINETY PERCENT OF THE US PUBLIC BELIEVES IN SOME KIND OF HIGHER POWER AND 55% PRAY DAILY. THE US PUBLIC ATTENDS RELIGIOUS SERVICES AT A RATE 3 TIMES HIGHER THAN SCIENTISTS IN THE US, WHO ARE AT RISK OF MISUNDERSTANDING THE ROLE RELIGION PLAYS IN ATTITUDES TOWARD GGH. FURTHER, BLACK, HISPANIC, AND RURAL POPULATIONS ATTEND RELIGIOUS SERVICES MORE FREQUENTLY THAN THE GENERAL US PUBLIC. CONCERNS WITH GGH ACTIVITIES MAY LEAD TO LOWER LEVELS OF ENGAGEMENT OF GGH, WHICH MAY IN TURN CONTRIBUTE TO HEALTH DISPARITIES. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO UNDERSTAND WHY HIGHER LEVELS OF RELIGIOUS PRACTICE ARE ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER CONCERNS WITH GGH ACTIVITIES. ADDITIONALLY, THIS PROJECT WILL INTERVIEW FAITH LEADERS TO IDENTIFY HOW PUBLIC HEALTH GENOMICS MIGHT ENGAGE FAITH COMMUNITIES IN WAYS THAT ARE RESPECTFUL AND CONSTRUCTIVE. WHILE SOME CONCERNS WITH HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGIES MAY DISAPPEAR WITH NEW INFORMATION, OTHERS STEM FROM WORLDVIEWS, DEEP MORAL COMMITMENTS, OR MISTRUST OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. ENGAGING RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES IS ESSENTIAL TO IDENTIFY WHICH CONCERNS CAN BE ADDRESSED WITH INFORMATION, WHICH CALL FOR ALTERNATIVE RESPONSES, AND WHAT ALTERNATIVE RESPONSES MIGHT LOOK LIKE. VERY FEW MODELS EXIST FOR GENOMIC PUBLIC HEALTH ENGAGEMENT WITH RELIGION, PARTICULARLY MODELS THAT DIRECTLY ADDRESS VALUE-LADEN CONCERNS.13,14 THIS PROJECT WILL ACHIEVE TWO SPECIFIC AIMS: 1. QUANTITATIVELY EXAMINE WHICH ASPECTS OF RELIGION EXPLAIN ITS INFLUENCE ON SUPPORT FOR GGH ACTIVITIES. WE WILL SURVEY 4800 ADULTS IN THE US TO EXAMINE THE ASSOCIATION OF RELIGIOUS VARIABLES WITH SUPPORT FOR GGH ACTIVITIES SUCH AS PRENATAL GENETIC TESTING, GENE EDITING, AND MRNA VACCINES. WE WILL GENERATE RICH DESCRIPTIVE DATA AND EXPLORE HOW AND WHEN DIVERSE RELIGIOUS VARIABLES PREDICT SUPPORT FOR, OR OPPOSITION TO, GGH ACTIVITIES. 2. EXPLORE HOW GENOMIC PUBLIC HEALTH CAN ENGAGE WITH RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES IN A WAY THAT IS RESPECTFUL AND CONSTRUCTIVE. WE WILL CONDUCT IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS VIA ZOOM WITH 180 FAITH LEADERS—30 FROM EACH OF SIX GROUPS: EVANGELICAL, MAINLINE PROTESTANT, HISTORICALLY BLACK, AND CATHOLIC CHRISTIANITY, JUDAISM, AND ISLAM. THESE GROUPS REPRESENT THE LARGEST RELIGIOUS GROUPS IN THE US, COMPRISING 90% OF THOSE WITH A RELIGIOUS AFFILIATION. INTERVIEWS WILL EXPLORE SEVERAL DIFFERENT ISSUES: WHAT ARE THEIR VIEWS ON GGH ACTIVITIES? IS DIVERSITY OF OPINION ON THESE MATTERS TOLERATED WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITY? TO WHAT EXTENT ARE CONCERNS WITH GGH ACTIVITIES PRINCIPLED AND TO WHAT EXTENT MIGHT FURTHER INFORMATION BE HELPFUL? HOW MIGHT GENOMIC PUBLIC HEALTH ENGAGE RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES IN A WAY THAT IS BOTH RESPECTFUL AND CONSTRUCTIVE?",3/23/2025,458341.0

HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT,"The Fair Housing Justice Center, Inc.","PURPOSE: PURPOSE: THE MISSION OF THE FAIR HOUSING JUSTICE CENTER (FHJC) IS TO ELIMINATE HOUSING DISCRIMINATION; PROMOTE POLICIES AND PROGRAMS THAT FOSTER OPEN, ACCESSIBLE, AND INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES; AND STRENGTHEN ENFORCEMENT OF FAIR HOUSING LAWS. THE FHJC IS SEEKING AN FY2024 FHIP FHOI CONTINUING DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT GRANT TO PROVIDE HIGH-QUALITY COMPREHENSIVE FAIR HOUSING TESTING SERVICES AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES, SPECIFICALLY IN PRE-APPLICATION MORTGAGE LENDING PRACTICES OF HOUSING SALES LENDERS.; ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED: ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED: THE FHJC WILL CONDUCT 35 FAIR HOUSING TESTS ACROSS ITS SERVICE AREA. INVESTIGATIONS WILL BE SYSTEMIC AND FOCUSED ON PRE-APPLICATION MORTGAGE LENDING PRACTICES AND HOUSING SALES TO DETERMINE WHETHER HOME BUYERS ARE BEING AFFORDED THE SAME SERVICE, TREATMENT, AND INFORMATION ABOUT AND ACCESS TO MORTGAGE FINANCING SERVICES AND PRODUCTS WITHOUT DISCRIMINATING BASED ON PROTECTED CHARACTERISTICS UNDER THE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT AND APPLICABLE LOCAL AND STATE LAWS. TESTING WILL FOCUS ON LENDERS LOCATED IN TOWNS, CITIES AND NEIGHBORHOODS THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY EXPERIENCED AND ARE EXPERIENCING PATTERNS OF RACIAL SEGREGATION. AS THE FHJC IS THE ONLY FULL SERVICE FAIR HOUSING ORGANIZATION OPERATING WITHIN THE FIVE NEW YORK CITY BOROUGHS, AND THERE IS A LACK OF LENDING TESTING HAPPENING IN THE REST OF THE NEW YORK CITY REGION, THERE WILL BE NO SHORTAGE OF AREAS AND ENTITIES ON WHICH TO FOCUS TESTING. LENDER TESTING INVESTIGATIONS ARE EXTREMELY TIME-CONSUMING, INVOLVE COMPLEX TRANSACTIONS, REQUIRE CAREFUL DESIGN AND SUPERVISION BY A SKILLED INVESTIGATIVE COORDINATOR, AND MUST BE EXECUTED BY TESTERS WHO ARE WELL-TRAINED AND WHO HAVE EXCEPTIONAL ACTING ABILITIES. THE FHJC HIRES AND TRAINS PROFESSIONAL ACTORS TO CONDUCT LENDING TESTS, AND THE FHJC’S NATIONAL PROJECTS AND INVESTIGATIONS COORDINATOR (PROPOSED PROJECT MANAGER) AND NATIONAL FIELD CONSULTANT HAVE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN LENDING TESTING. THEY ARE TRAINERS FOR THE HUD FHIP FUNDED INVESTIGATIVE SUPPORT FOR TESTING AND ENFORCEMENT PROGRAMS (ISTEP). IN THIS CAPACITY THEY HAVE TRAINED HUNDREDS OF INVESTIGATIVE COORDINATORS ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN BEST PRACTICES FOR FAIR HOUSING TESTING IN SALES, LENDING, AND RENTALS. THEIR EXPERIENCE IS FURTHER DESCRIBED IN THE STAFF EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE SECTION. THE FHJC CURRENTLY EMPLOYS 8 INVESTIGATIVE COORDINATORS, INCLUDING A DIRECTOR OF INVESTIGATIONS (8 YEARS GENERAL TESTING EXPERIENCE), A NATIONAL PROJECTS AND INVESTIGATIONS COORDINATOR (6 YEARS GENERAL TESTING EXPERIENCE), AND A NATIONAL FIELD CONSULTANT (48 YEARS GENERAL TESTING EXPERIENCE), EACH OF WHOM SUPERVISES TESTING INVESTIGATIONS. THE FHJC ALSO EMPLOYS AN EVIDENCE MANAGER (4 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE) WHO PROVIDES SUPPORT TO THE INVESTIGATIVE COORDINATORS AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONTROL, TRANSFER, MAINTENANCE, AND STORAGE OF ALL TESTING DATA AND EVIDENCE. MANY OF THESE STAFF MEMBERS HAVE DIRECT EXPERIENCE CONDUCTING LENDING AND SALES TESTING. THE FHJC HAS ALSO DEVELOPED WHAT IS LIKELY THE MOST PROFESSIONAL AND EXTENSIVE POOL OF TESTERS IN THE COUNTRY.; EXPECTED OUTCOMES: EXPECTED OUTCOMES: TO OVERCOME THE SIGNIFICANT EXISTING BARRIERS OF SYSTEMIC DISCRIMINATION AND SEGREGATION, THE FHJC USES EVIDENCE THAT REVEALS A PATTERN OF SYSTEMIC DISCRIMINATION TO BRING ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AGAINST HOUSING PROVIDERS, REAL ESTATE AGENTS, AND LENDING INSTITUTIONS. ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS WILL INCLUDE FILING LAWSUITS AND ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLAINTS WITH LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL AGENCIES. THE FHJC WILL ALSO PROVIDE INTAKE COUNSELING TO INDIVIDUALS WHO BELIEVE THEY HAVE BEEN DISCRIMINATED AGAINST IN THE LENDING CONTEXT, AND REFERRALS TO LEGAL COUNSEL IF APPROPRIATE. IF THESE INDIVIDUALS BRING THEIR OWN ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, THE FHJC WILL BE AVAILABLE IF NEEDED. THE FHJC’S OUTREACH, SOCIAL MEDIA, AND WRITTEN MATERIAL DISTRIBUTED AS PART OF THIS PROJECT WILL ENSURE THAT ADVOCATES AND AFFECTED COMMUNITY MEMBERS UNDERSTAND THEIR FAIR HOUSING RIGHTS, KNOW HOW TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FHJC’S SERVICES, ARE ABLE TO ENGAGE IN SELF-ADVOCACY, AND ARE AWARE OF WHERE THEY CAN BRING AN ENFORCEMENT ACTION. THE FHJC COLLECTS EVIDENCE IN AN IMPARTIAL MANNER, DOCUMENTING THE EVERYDAY, UNVARNISHED BUSINESS OPERATIONS OF HOUSING PROVIDERS. AS SUCH, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE OR APPROPRIATE TO PREDICT OR ESTIMATE THE NUMBER OR NATURE OF ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS IT WILL FILE. THIS WOULD ALSO HAVE THE POSSIBLE EFFECT OF COMPROMISING ITS LAWSUITS. HOWEVER, IT IS PRUDENT TO NOTE THAT THE FHJC’S SERVICE AREA HAS A POPULATION OF OVER THIRTEEN MILLION PEOPLE, INCLUDING THE NATION’S LARGEST CITY. THE SCALE OF FAIR HOUSING INVESTIGATIONS IN THIS AREA REMAINS WOEFULLY INADEQUATE AND THE FHJC’S LITIGATION PROGRAM IS ROBUST AND SUCCESSFUL. IN CONSIDERING THE EXPECTED OUTCOMES OF THIS PROJECT, PAST FHJC LAWSUITS ARE INSTRUCTIVE. IN FEBRUARY 2015, THE FHJC AND NINE BLACK, LATINO, ASIAN, AND WHITE TESTERS FILED A FEDERAL LAWSUIT AGAINST M&T BANK, THE 17TH LARGEST BANK IN THE UNITED STATES, ALLEGING THAT THE BANK WAS ENGAGED IN DISCRIMINATION BASED ON RACE AND NATIONAL ORIGIN. THE CASE, FHJC ET AL. V. M&T BANK ET AL., IS BELIEVED TO BE THE FIRST LAWSUIT FILED UNDER THE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT ALLEGING RACE AND NATIONAL ORIGIN DISCRIMINATION BASED PRIMARILY ON EVIDENCE COLLECTED THROUGH A PRE-APPLICATION MORTGAGE LENDER TESTING INVESTIGATION. IN AUGUST 2015, THE CASE WAS RESOLVED FOR A TOTAL MONETARY RECOVERY OF $485,000 AND EXTENSIVE INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, INCLUDING ADOPTING A BANK-WIDE POLICY PROHIBITING STEERING, POSTING ITS REVISED FAIR LENDING POLICY ON ITS WEBSITE, AND RETAINING A CONSULTANT TO REVISE ITS FAIR LENDING TRAINING FOR LOAN OFFICERS AND OTHER BANK EMPLOYEES. M&T LOAN OFFICERS IN THE FHJC’S SERVICE AREA ARE NOW PROVIDING WRITTEN ESTIMATES, UPON REQUEST, TO CONSUMERS CONCERNING LOAN AMOUNTS, LOAN PRODUCTS, HOME PURCHASE PRICES, INTEREST RATES, AND DOWN PAYMENT REQUIREMENTS. IN NOVEMBER 2016, THE FHJC FILED A SUIT AGAINST ULSTER SAVINGS BANK FOR LENDING DISCRIMINATION, ALSO BASED ON EVIDENCE GATHERED IN PRE-APPLICATION LENDING TESTING. THE FHJC CONDUCTED A TWO-YEAR TESTING INVESTIGATION, WHICH REVEALED THAT LOAN OFFICERS REPEATEDLY RECOMMENDED LOWER HOME PRICES AND LOAN AMOUNTS AND LESS FAVORABLE TERMS FOR BLACK APPLICANTS WHO PRESENTED BETTER QUALIFICATIONS—HIGHER INCOMES, MORE ASSETS, LESS DEBT, AND BETTER CREDIT SCORES—THAN THE WHITE TESTERS WITH WHOM THEY WERE MATCHED. IN THE 2017 LAWSUIT SETTLEMENT, ULSTER SAVINGS BANK AGREED TO EXTENSIVE INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.; INTENDED BENEFICIARIES: NTENDED BENEFICIARIES: THIS PROJECT WILL BENEFIT HOMEBUYERS IN THE NEW YORK CITY REGION WITH ANY CHARACTERISTIC THAT IS PROTECTED UNDER LOCAL, STATE, OR FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING LAWS. IN PARTICULAR, IT WILL FOCUS ON ELIMINATING DISCRIMINATION AGAINST PEOPLE WHO ARE BLACK, LATINO, OR ASIAN AMERICAN PACIFIC ISLANDER (AAPI) AND MENA (MIDDLE EASTERN AND NORTH AFRICAN) COMMUNITY MEMBERS, AS WELL AS IMMIGRANTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY (LEP). AMONG THESE GROUPS, THE FHJC SERVES COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED HISTORIC AND CONTINUING PATTERNS OF SEGREGATION, DISCRIMINATION, AND EXCLUSION IN HOUSING – ACROSS VARIOUS AND INTERSECTING LINES INCLUDING DISABILITY, LAWFUL SOURCE OF INCOME, SEX, SEXUAL ORIENTATION/GENDER IDENTITY, RELIGION, CITIZENSHIP/IMMIGRATION STATUS, FAMILIAL STATUS, AND AGE. MANY THEORIES HAVE BEEN ADVANCED OVER THE YEARS ABOUT WHAT TRANSPIRES WHEN EQUALLY QUALIFIED CONSUMERS OF DIFFERENT RACES AND NATIONAL ORIGINS CONTACT LENDERS TO SEEK FINANCING TO PURCHASE A HOME. TESTING IS ONE OF THE FEW INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES THAT CAN BE USED TO OBSERVE EXACTLY WHAT OCCURS AT THE PRE-APPLICATION STAGE OF A MORTGAGE LENDING TRANSACTION. BECAUSE OF THE INSIDIOUS NATURE OF DISCRIMINATORY LENDING PRACTICES, IT IS OFTEN DIFFICULT FOR CONSUMERS OF DIFFERENT RACES AND NATIONAL ORIGINS TO KNOW IF LOAN OFFICERS ARE PROVIDING THE SAME LEVEL OF ASSISTANCE, SERVICE, TREATMENT, AND FINANCING INFORMATION WITHOUT SOME TYPE OF COMPARISON. TESTING IS THE ONLY INVESTIGATIVE TOOL THAT CAN PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL COMPARISON AT THE PRE APPLICATION STAGE OF A MORTGAGE LENDING TRANSACTION. THE WORK OF THE FHJC IN THIS AREA HAS BEEN GROUND-BREAKING AND SINCE LITTLE LENDER TESTING IS CONDUCTED NATIONALLY, IT HAS PROVIDED A FRAMEWORK FOR HOW TO DEVELOP MORTGAGE LENDING CASES BASED PRIMARILY ON TESTING EVIDENCE AT THE PRE-APPLICATION STAGE RATHER THAN SOLELY RELYING ON DATA OBTAINED AFTER AN INDIVIDUAL HAS APPLIED. THIS PROCESS HAS UNVEILED VALUABLE INSIGHTS INTO LENDER PRACTICES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN WIDELY RESEARCHED OR INVESTIGATED BY FAIR LENDING ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. THE NEW YORK CITY REGION HAS ONE OF THE MOST DIVERSE POPULATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, AND YET, HOUSING DISCRIMINATION AND RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION ARE DEEPLY PERVASIVE. BY APPLYING A DISSIMILARITY INDEX TO 2020 CENSUS DATA, RESEARCHERS HAVE SHOWN THAT NEW YORK CITY IS ONE OF THE MOST SEGREGATED METROPOLITAN REGIONS IN THE COUNTRY. IT REMAINS ONE OF SIX METROPOLITAN REGIONS WITH A SEGREGATION INDEX ABOVE 80. OF THE 50 METROPOLITAN AREAS IN THE NATION WITH THE LARGEST BLACK, LATINO, AND AAPI POPULATIONS, THE NEW YORK REGION RANKS AS ONE OF THE MOST SEGREGATED AREAS FOR ALL THREE GROUPS. THIS PROJECT WILL BENEFIT PEOPLE OF COLOR WHO LIVE IN SEGREGATED COMMUNITIES AND ALLOW THEM TO LIVE WITHOUT PENALTY IN NEIGHBORHOODS OF THEIR CHOICE. FURTHERMORE, THIS PROJECT WILL BENEFIT ALL RESIDENTS OF THE NEW YORK CITY REGION. HOUSING DISCRIMINATION DOES IMMENSE HARM NOT ONLY TO FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS, BUT TO ENTIRE COMMUNITIES. HOUSING DISCRIMINATION NOT ONLY RESTRICTS HOUSING CHOICE BUT ALSO PERPETUATES RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION. SEGREGATION OFTEN LEADS TO FURTHER DISENFRANCHISEMENT, AS COMMUNITIES OF COLOR, BASED ON THE ZIP CODES TO WHICH THEY ARE CONFINED, FACE ADDITIONAL BARRIERS IN THEIR ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE, EDUCATION, TRANSPORTATION, AND EMPLOYMENT. THIS PROJECT WILL HELP ADDRESS THIS LEGACY OF HISTORICAL DISCRIMINATION.; SUBRECIPIENT ACTIVITIES: NONE",2/27/2025,216667.0

AS A COMMUNITY ACTION AGENCY AND A REGIONAL ADMINISTRATION AGENCY, CTI ADMINISTERS A VARIETY OF HOUSING PROGRAMS INCLUDING RENTAL ASSISTANCE (HOUSING SUBSIDIES), EMERGENCY SHELTER SERVICES, AND THE HCEC. CTI IS A RECIPIENT OF HUD COC, CSBG, HOME, AND ESG FUNDS. CTI ENGAGES IN DATA DRIVEN APPROACHES TO ASSESSING COMMUNITY NEEDS, IDENTIFYING IMPEDIMENTS, AND SETTING MEANINGFUL GOALS TO ADVANCE AND FURTHER FAIR HOUSING.; ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED: ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED: THE ACTIVITIES PROPOSED UNDER THIS GRANT FALL INTO FOUR GENERAL CATEGORIES: RECEIVING, ASSISTING, AND REFERRING FAIR HOUSING COMPLAINTS FOR ENFORCEMENT; CONDUCTING FAIR HOUSING TRAININGS; CONDUCTING FAIR HOUSING AND AFFH OUTREACH; AND INCLUSIVE ZONING ADVOCACY TO FURTHER FAIR HOUSING. WHILE THIS GRANT SERVES TENANTS AND HOMEOWNERS WITH MEMBERSHIP IN ALL PROTECTED CLASSES, THERE ARE SOME COMMON THEMES THAT RUN ACROSS ALL CATEGORIES OF ACTIVITIES. THESE COMMON THEMES ARE DELIBERATE AND ARE A RESPONSE TO DEMONSTRATED NEED DERIVED FROM FHP DATA COLLECTED OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS AS WELL AS RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS ON A REGIONAL, STATE, AND NATIONAL LEVEL. NOTABLY, FURTHERING FAIR HOUSING AND PROMOTING INCLUSIVE ZONING POLICIES IS INCORPORATED INTO MOST IF NOT ALL OUTREACH ACTIVITIES AND TRAININGS. THE FHP USES ALL OPPORTUNITIES TO INTRODUCE AND ENCOURAGE PARTICIPATION IN HOUSING CHOICE AND AFFH ADVOCACY. SECOND, WHILE OUTREACH IS CONDUCTED REGIONALLY AND THERE IS A GENERALIZED EFFORT TO INCREASE ON-SITE OUTREACH IN THE COMING YEAR, TARGETED EFFORT WILL ME MADE TO REACH SENIORS WHO OFTEN REPORT DISABILITY AND FIXED INCOME RELATED HOUSING INSTABILITY AND PEOPLE WITH LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY NEEDS. THESE TARGETED EFFORTS WILL BE MADE BOTH IN OUTREACH AND TRAINING ACTIVITIES WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT IT WILL ALSO LEAD TO INCREASE USE OF FHP COMPLAINT AND REFERRAL SERVICES. THE FHP INTAKES COMPLAINTS OF HOUSING DISCRIMINATION FOR ALL FEDERALLY PROTECTED CLASSES AND ISSUES. TWO STAFF ENGAGE IN COMPLAINT SERVICES AND CTI IS PROJECTED TO HIRE A NEW FAIR HOUSING CASE MANAGER. THE CASE MANAGER WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE GENERAL HOUSING DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINT SERVICES AND RELATED SERVICES INCLUDING HOUSING SEARCH AND APPLICATIONS FOR AND ADVOCACY WITH RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS (UNDER HCEC FUNDING). THE FHP HAS DETAILED INTAKE AND COMPLAINT, AND REFERRAL SERVICES AND A COMPLEMENTARY CLIENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM TO AID AND TRACK COMPLAINT INFORMATION. THE COMPLAINTS PROGRAM PROVIDES THREE CORE SERVICES TO PEOPLE REQUESTING ASSISTANCE: INFORMATION AND RESOURCES; TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE; AND REFERRAL TO LEGAL SERVICES FOR ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES (HUD OR THE MASSACHUSETTS COMMISSION AGAINST DISCRIMINATION). TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IS A SUCCESSFUL FEATURE OF THE COMPLAINTS PROGRAM, AND ALLOWS FHP STAFF TO FAVORABLY RESOLVE COMPLAINTS OF HOUSING DISCRIMINATION QUICKLY AND WITHOUT HAVING TO REFER TO FAIR HOUSING ENFORCEMENT. KEY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE INCLUDES HELPING CLIENTS REQUEST ACCOMMODATIONS AND MODIFICATIONS, CONFRONT HOUSING PROVIDERS TO STOP DISCRIMINATORY ACTIVITY, HELP DRAFT ENFORCEMENT COMPLAINTS, ACCESS ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS RELATED TO HOUSING BENEFITS, AND ASK FOR VAWA PROTECTIONS. THE FHP CLIENT MANAGEMENT DATABASE TRACKS COMPLAINTS BY PROTECTED CLASS, LEGAL ISSUE, GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION, RACE/ETHNICITY (VOLUNTARY), AGE, AND SERVICE PROVIDED, INCLUDING AGENCY TO WHICH THE CLIENT WAS REFERRED. FAIR HOUSING TRAININGS ARE OFFERED VIRTUALLY AND IN THE COMMUNITY. UNDER THIS PROPOSED TARGETED GRANT, ADDITIONAL EMPHASIS IS PLACED ON OFFERING TRAININGS TO MEET THE LANGUAGE NEEDS OF LEP POPULATIONS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. THE FHP HAS HAD EFFECTIVE RESPONSES CONDUCTING OUTREACH WITH SENIOR CENTERS, PUBLIC SCHOOLS, ADULT EDUCATION CENTERS (WITH ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNER COURSES) AND ACO/HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. THESE EXPERIENCES HAVE PROVIDED METHODOLOGIES FOR MORE FOCUSED OUTREACH AND TRAINING ACTIVITIES TO LEP POPULATIONS, AND HAVE SUPPORTED THE CREATION OF REFERRAL PARTNERSHIPS WITH AGENCIES THAT SERVE PRIMARILY NON-NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKERS. THE FHP ALREADY HAS A GENERAL FAIR HOUSING, DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION, CRIMINAL RECORDS, TENANT RIGHTS, AND ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS’ TRAININGS DEVELOPED. THESE TRAININGS ARE TRANSLATED INTO SPANISH, PORTUGUESE, AND KHMER, AND CTI WILL ENGAGE STAFF TO PROVIDE THESE TRAININGS IN THOSE LANGUAGES. PROPOSED ACTIVITIES INCLUDE ON-SITE TRAININGS FOR AT LEAST 200 PEOPLE, 100 OF WHICH WILL BE IN SPANISH, PORTUGUESE, AND KHMER AS WELL AS VIRTUAL TRAININGS. OUTREACH ACTIVITIES ARE DESIGNED TO BROADLY PROMOTE FAIR HOUSING AND AFFH ADVOCACY THROUGHOUT OUR 70 COMMUNITIES. THESE ACTIVITIES INCLUDE SOCIAL MEDIAL OUTREACH, MAINTAINING A FAIR HOUSING PAGE WITH ONLINE REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE, TRAINING REGISTRATION, AND A RESOURCE LIBRARY. OUTREACH ACTIVITIES INCLUDE MAINTAINING CONTACTS WITH MUNICIPALITIES AND PHAS, HOUSING PROVIDERS, AND TENANTS/RESIDENTS TO PROMOTE FAIR HOUSING MATERIALS AND INFORMATION. THE FHP WILL ALSO ATTEND COMMUNITY EVENTS TO CONDUCT OUTREACH WITH A FOCUS ON EVENTS THAT WILL REACH LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT (LEP) POPULATIONS. THE FHP WILL ALSO CONTINUE OUTREACH AND EDUCATION FOR MUNICIPALITIES AND PHAS CONSISTENT WITH THIS CURRENT GRANT’S AFFH ACTIVITIES AND WILL ENGAGE IN COMMUNITY ORGANIZING AND ADVOCACY FOR INCLUSIVE ZONING IN THE LOWELL REGION THAT OVERLAPS WITH CTI’S CSBG CATCHMENT AREA.

IN ADDITION TO OUTREACH CONDUCTED THROUGH THESE LISTSERVS, THE FHP WILL MAKE 26 FAIR HOUSING POSTS USING CTI SOCIAL MEDIAL PLATFORMS (TWITTER, FACEBOOK, INSTAGRAM, AND LINKEDIN) AS WELL AS 4 PSA THROUGH LOCAL MEDIA OUTLETS. EXPECTED OUTCOMES FOR AFFH ACTIVITIES: AFFH, HOUSING CHOICE AND INCLUSIONARY ZONING WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO GENERAL TRAINING AND OUTREACH ACTIVITIES.

CTI AND THE FHP FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT FAIR HOUSING AND FURTHERING FAIR HOUSING BENEFITS EVERYONE. FHP ACTIVITIES ARE TARGETED TO INFORM AND ASSIST WITH ALL TYPES OF HOUSING DISCRIMINATION (INCLUDING SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE UNDER VAWA) AND ALL FEDERALLY PROTECTED CLASSES. THAT SAID, THE FHP ALSO UNDERSTANDS THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE HARMED BY HOUSING INEQUALITIES. THE FHP USES REGIONAL DATA AND RESEARCH ALONG WITH DATA COLLECTED DURING BY CTI DURING ITS COMMUNITY NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND THE DATA COLLECTED BY THE FHP THROUGH COMPLAINT SERVICES AND TRAININGS. IN THIS CAPACITY, THE FHP HAS IDENTIFIED SEVERAL PROTECTED GROUPS AND REGIONS THAT NEED FOCUSED ATTENTION AND TARGETED PROGRAMMING. GEOGRAPHICALLY, CTI WILL ENSURE IT IS ESTABLISHING CONTACT AND PARTNERSHIPS WITH ORGANIZATIONS IN OUR HUB CITIES, WHERE THERE ARE REGIONAL CONCENTRATIONS ON PEOPLE WITH LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY (LEP). THESE SAME HUB CITIES HAVE HIGHER CONCENTRATIONS OF BLACK AND BROWN POPULATIONS.

THE FHP RECEIVES A LARGE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS ALLEGING DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION, AND EXPECTS TO SERVE A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES IN ITS COMPLAINT SERVICE. TRAININGS OFFERED TO SENIOR CENTERS AND ACO/HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS CAN FOCUS ON REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS AND MODIFICATIONS. AS SUCH, PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ARE ALSO EXPECTED TO BE BENEFICIARIES. FINALLY, THE FHP EXPECTS THE LOWELL AND THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES TO BENEFIT FROM THE COMMUNITY EVENTS/MEETINGS THAT WILL BE CONDUCTED TO INCREASE AWARENESS OF AND ADVOCACY FOR INCLUSIONARY ZONING. EDUCATION AND OUTREACH ON AFFH WILL CONTINUE REGIONALLY, BUT THE FHP WILL FOCUS ADDITIONAL EFFORTS IN CTI’S CSBG REGION (LOWELL AND THE SEVEN ADJACENT COMMUNITIES); SUBRECIPIENT ACTIVITIES: NONE",2/27/2025,62500.0

HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT,"H.O.P.E., Inc. d/b/a HOPE Fair Housing Center","PURPOSE: PURPOSE THE PURPOSE OF THE PROPOSED GRANT PROJECT IS TO INCREASE AWARENESS AND UNDERSTANDING OF FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL FAIR HOUSING LAWS. THE ACTIVITIES PROPOSED BY UNDER THIS GRANT APPLICATION RECOGNIZE THAT PEOPLE OF COLOR, WOMEN, AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ARE OVERREPRESENTED IN PUBLIC AND SUBSIDIZED HOUSING. IN RECENT YEARS, ADDITIONAL FAIR HOUSING PROTECTIONS AT THE STATE LEVEL AND FEDERAL GUIDANCE HAVE EXPANDED THE FAIR HOUSING RIGHTS OF THESE GROUPS. A LACK OF UP-TO-DATE KNOWLEDGE IN COMMUNITIES CREATES A BARRIER TO PROTECTED GROUPS ACCESSING THEIR SPECIFIC HOUSING RIGHTS AND NEEDS. THIS PROJECT WILL COUNTERACT KNOWLEDGE GAPS IN FAIR HOUSING RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES. OUTREACH IS A KEY FACTOR IN CONNECTING VICTIMS OF HOUSING DISCRIMINATION AND HOUSING PROVIDERS WITH THE TOOLS AND RESOURCES TO UNDERSTAND AND ACCESS THEIR FAIR HOUSING RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES. A MAJOR BARRIER TO ACHIEVING THIS JUSTICE IS A SIMPLE LACK OF KNOWLEDGE. THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO GO BEYOND GENERAL EDUCATION AND PROVIDE MORE SPECIFIC EDUCATION AND OUTREACH TOOLS AND RESOURCES FOR PUBLIC HOUSING AGENCIES (PHAS) AND POPULATIONS ELIGIBLE FOR OR LIVING IN PUBLIC AND SUBSIDIZED HOUSING. A MAJOR FOCUS OF THIS PROJECT WILL BE THE TREATMENT OF ARREST & CONVICTION RECORDS. ILLINOIS HAS 1.8 MILLION BLACK RESIDENTS AND 2.3 MILLION HISPANIC OR LATINO RESIDENTS. THESE TWO GROUPS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY REPRESENTED IN ARREST & CONVICTION DATA. HOPE RECOGNIZES THE NEED FOR INCREASED EDUCATION ACROSS THE STATE OF ILLINOIS WHICH INCLUDES OVER 100 PHAS. HOPE’S SERVICE AREA ALSO INCLUDES MANY VULNERABLE AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. AS THE ONLY AGENCY PROVIDING FAIR HOUSING SERVICES IN MOST OF THE FORTY COUNTIES WITHIN ITS SERVICE AREA – INCLUDING EDUCATION AND OUTREACH SERVICES – HOPE CONTINUES TO PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN PROVIDING FAIR HOUSING TRAINING, RESOURCES, AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO MEET THESE NEEDS.; ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED: ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED 1) UPDATE HOPE’S PUBLIC HOUSING AGENCIES FAIR HOUSING MANUAL. HOPE WILL UPDATE ITS PUBLIC HOUSING AGENCIES (PHA) FAIR HOUSING MANUAL, PUBLISHED IN 2014, TO INCLUDE UPDATED GUIDANCE FROM HUD ON FAIR HOUSING LAW AS WELL AS STATE LEVEL LAWS RELEVANT TO PHAS. BY UPDATING THIS MANUAL, PHAS WILL BE BETTER INFORMED ON HOW TO FOLLOW FAIR HOUSING LAW WHEN SERVING PROTECTED GROUPS INCLUDING PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES, SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, PERSONS WITH ARREST & CONVICTION RECORDS, AND MORE. HOPE WILL ENSURE THE DEVELOPED MANUAL IS MADE AVAILABLE TO PHAS THROUGHOUT ITS SERVICE AREA AND ACROSS THE STATE OF ILLINOIS. 2) CONDUCT PRESENTATIONS/TRAININGS ON PHA FAIR HOUSING MANUAL. TO ENSURE PHAS ARE MADE AWARE OF THEIR UPDATED FAIR HOUSING RESPONSIBILITIES, HOPE WILL CONDUCT THREE TRAININGS TO PHA STAFF ON THE UPDATED MANUAL. THROUGH THESE TRAININGS, HOPE WILL DISCUSS THE MANUAL, HIGHLIGHT KEY CHANGES AND UPDATES, AND PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PHA STAFF TO ASK QUESTIONS. THROUGH THESE TRAININGS, HOPE WILL CONNECT WITH PHAS, PROVIDE THEM WITH THE UPDATED PHA FAIR HOUSING MANUAL AND ANY OTHER HOPE RESOURCES OR GUIDANCE HIGHLIGHTED IN THE MANUAL OR REQUESTED BY THE PHA. 3) DEVELOP TOOLS AND RESOURCES REGARDING ARREST & CONVICTION RECORDS IN PUBLIC HOUSING. THROUGH ITS RECENT FHIP-EOI STRIVING FOR EQUITY GRANT, HOPE CREATED AN ARREST & CONVICTION RECORD TOOLKIT WHICH INCLUDED RESOURCES FOR INDIVIDUALS FACING DISCRIMINATION, FLYERS AND REFERRAL GUIDES FOR ORGANIZATIONS COUNSELING CLIENTS, AND ADVERTISING DRAFTS FOR ONLINE AND NEWSPAPER OUTREACH. HOPE WILL MODIFY THE RESOURCES IN THIS TOOLKIT TO CREATE NEW TOOLS AND RESOURCES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH ARREST & CONVICTIONS RECORDS WHO LIVE OR SEEK TO LIVE IN PUBLIC OR SUBSIDIZED HOUSING. THE UPDATES WILL FOCUS ON HUD GUIDANCE AND ILLINOIS LAW (PUBLIC HOUSING ACCESS BILL AND HOUSING AUTHORITIES ACT). 4) DEVELOP ADVERTISING MATERIALS ADDRESSING ARREST & CONVICTION RECORD. THROUGH HOPE’S DEVELOPMENT AND CREATION OF ITS ARREST & CONVICTION RECORD TOOLKIT FOR POPULATIONS ELIGIBLE FOR OR LIVING IN PUBLIC AND SUBSIDIZED HOUSING, HOPE WILL CREATE TWO SOCIAL MEDIA/ONLINE MARKETING MATERIALS SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSING FAIR HOUSING PROTECTIONS FOR THOSE WITH ARREST & CONVICTION RECORDS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE PUBLIC AND SUBSIDIZED HOUSING. ADDITIONALLY, HOPE WILL CREATE ONE DIGITAL OR ONLINE NEWSPAPER ADVERTISING ADDRESSING ARREST & CONVICTION RECORD PROTECTIONS. 5) CONDUCT ONLINE OUTREACH. HOPE WILL HOST ALL THE MATERIALS DESCRIBED ABOVE ON ITS WEBSITE AND PROMOTE THEM ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS TO SPREAD AWARENESS. IN ADDITION, HOPE WILL CREATE ONE VIDEO SHOWCASING CLIENT TESTIMONIAL. THIS TESTIMONIAL WILL HIGHLIGHT THE EXPERIENCE OF HOPE’S CLIENT(S) WHO FACED HOUSING DISCRIMINATION HOUSING DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF THEIR ARREST AND/OR CONVICTION RECORD. THE VIDEO WILL ALSO HIGHLIGHT WHERE TO SEEK HELP AND HOW TO REPORT INSTANCES OF UNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATION. THE TESTIMONIAL VIDEO WILL BE PROMOTED ACROSS HOPE’S SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AND HOSTED ON ITS WEBSITE. 6) DISTRIBUTE ALL NEWLY DEVELOPED MATERIALS. ONCE HOPE HAS CREATED ITS NEW OUTREACH MATERIALS AND RECEIVED APPROVAL FROM THE GTM, FOCUS WILL SHIFT TOWARDS DISSEMINATING THE MATERIALS THROUGHOUT ILLINOIS. HOPE WILL ENGAGE DIRECTLY WITH PHAS TO DISTRIBUTE THE PHA FAIR HOUSING MANUAL (EITHER VIRTUALLY OR IN PERSON) AND LATER HOST IT ON HOPE’S WEBSITE FOR PHA STAFF AND INTERESTED PARTIES TO ACCESS. HOPE WILL DISTRIBUTE THE ARREST & CONVICTION RECORD TOOLKIT VIA SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AND ITS WEBSITE. HOPE WILL ADDITIONALLY TRANSLATE PUBLICLY DISSEMINATED MATERIALS INTO SPANISH AND MANDARIN TO MAKE THEM MORE ACCESSIBLE TO RELEVANT POPULATIONS IN HOPE’S SERVICE AREA.; EXPECTED OUTCOMES: HOPE WILL UPDATE ITS 2014 PHA FAIR HOUSING MANUAL TO INCLUDE UPDATED GUIDANCE FROM HUD ON FAIR HOUSING LAW AS WELL AS STATE LEVEL LAWS RELEVANT TO PHAS.
