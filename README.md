# Doge Scraping

This is a project to scrape the Department of Government Efficiency website to grab useful information for ease of processing. 

## dogeScrape.py
* dogeScrape handles accessing doge.gov to grab all of the data and download the raw html from each of the tables
* As of now, the scraper manually clicks on every pagination link for each table and simply downloads the entire selected paginated table

## tableParse.py
* After the html files are scraped, the tableParse script will actually process all of the html data and turn it into csv files

## exploreData.py
* This is sort of my data playgroud that I use to test the scripts, make a report, etc.



## Future features 
- Some plans to implement some contract data extension using the federal apis (thanks to this github: https://github.com/m-nolan/doge-scrape)
- I want to have a live updating feature and create api endpoints for the doge website for easy use and increased government transparency. It would just be a bunch of json files what are generated by the doge website
