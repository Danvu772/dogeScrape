# Doge Scraping

This is a project to scrape the Department of Government Efficiency website to grab useful information for ease of processing. 

Few notes for current version:
- There is no actual web scraping for the website yet. The html of the expanded table was simply downloaded into an html file in the project folder. BeautifulSoup is used to process the data and convert it into csv files. 
- Due to a design oversight, the process of data population into the csv from the html files is done using a fixed structure (what was I thinking?)
    - what will have to be done is to include the entire table in the html, and populate the data for every type of table (duh!)
- Some plans to implement some contract data extension using the federal apis (thanks to this github: https://github.com/m-nolan/doge-scrape)
- I want to have a live updating feature and create api endpoints for the doge website for easy use and increased government transparency. It would just be a bunch of json files what are generated by the doge website
